# Smart Document Assistant - README

## üöÄ Overview

Welcome to **Smart Document Assistant**, a powerful web application designed to help you upload, store, and manage documents, as well as ask insightful questions based on the contents of those documents. With the integration of AI models like **Ollama** and tools like **DuckDuckGo Search**, this assistant can help you analyze and retrieve the information you need from both local documents and the web.

### Key Features
- **User Authentication**: Register and log in securely to access personalized features.
- **Document Upload**: Upload and store **PDF** or **TXT** documents.
- **Document Management**: View, delete, and organize documents in your collection.
- **Question Answering**: Ask questions based on the contents of your documents, or search the web for relevant answers.
- **Profanity Filter**: Automatically filters out inappropriate language in documents and queries.
- **Word Cloud Visualization**: Visualize the most frequent terms in your documents with word clouds.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit (for building interactive UIs)
- **Backend**: Python
- **AI Models**: 
  - **Ollama** for AI-driven responses
  - **SentenceTransformers** for text embedding generation
  - **DuckDuckGo Search API** for web search results

## üí° How It Works

### Authentication System
- **Registration**: Users can create an account by choosing a username and password.
- **Login**: Existing users can log in with their credentials.
- **Logout**: Users can log out anytime during the session.

### Document Handling
- **Upload**: Users can upload documents in **PDF** or **TXT** format. The document‚Äôs content is cleaned and profaned words are censored before saving.
- **Storage**: Once uploaded, documents are stored in a database with text embeddings generated for future reference.
- **Management**: Users can view a list of saved documents and delete them as needed.

### Question Answering
- **Text Embeddings**: Text from documents is converted into embeddings, which allow for efficient search and retrieval.
- **Ask Questions**: Users can ask questions, and the system will either search for relevant document content or query the web using DuckDuckGo Search.
- **AI-Driven Answers**: Ollama‚Äôs language model generates accurate and context-aware answers based on the documents or web search results.

### Visualizations
- **Word Cloud**: Displays a word cloud of the most frequently used words in the document‚Äôs text, providing a quick overview of its content.
